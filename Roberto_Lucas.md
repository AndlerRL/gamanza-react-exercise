a.1. I couldn't implement the episode page.
a.2. Didn't finish all the type of sorts, only 'name'.

b.1. There was only a bug that was not on the list: Themes. 
I really wanted to add it to this exercise, because it's pretty
easy and saw that the bug was consuming the time, so I stopped
almost half way and continue with the TODO list.

c.1. Finish the Homepage.
c.2. Fix the theme bug that I encounter.
c.3. Add animations, I really like it and have some user feedbacks.
c.4. Create the Episode page, so I could do a cool thing that came into my mind with basic animation.
c.5. Contemplate a little more what I did.
